# The task of this program is calculation of WhoScored.com effectiveness in prediction of managerial
# decisions in the UEFA Champions League matches of the seasons from 2010/2011 to 2019/2020. This script gets data about
# predicted squads and starting line-ups from the html files with WhoScored.com webpages on the local disk.
# The program downloads necessary data and compares squads for every UEFA Champions League match having its "Preview"
# section on the WhoScored.com. Finally, program displays the result on the console.
# Tools used: Python 3.8, BeautifulSoup 4.9.1
