# The task of this program is saving the data about UEFA Champions League matches into the database SQLite.
# These data include in the html files in the directory "Matches" on the local disk. The script saves into the
# local database into table "UCL_Matches" these informations about the UCL matches: index, team home, team away, season,
# hoScored id of match, date, path to file with "Centre", path to file with "Preview", link to the website with "Centre".
# Data about teams are saved into table "Team": Whoscored id of team, team name, league (country), link to webpage.
# Tools used: Python 3.8, BeautifulSoup  4.9.1, SQLite 3.28.0
